# Subscription-management-system
A backend application built with Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB to manage user accounts and subscriptions, with automated email reminders for subscription renewals.

## ðŸ“– Overview
The Subscription Management System is a RESTful API designed to handle user authentication, subscription management, and periodic email reminders for subscription renewals. Users can sign up, log in, manage their subscriptions, and receive automated email notifications for upcoming renewals. 

The project is built for scalability and security, using JWT for authentication and MongoDB for data persistence.

## âœ¨ Features
1. **User Authentication**
     - Sign up with name, email, and password (passwords hashed with bcrypt).
     - Log in to receive a JWT for secure access.
     - Log out to invalidate session.
       
2. **User Management**
     - Create single or multiple users.
     - Store user data securely in MongoDB.
       
3. **Subscription Management**
     - Add, view, update, or delete subscriptions for each user.
     - Subscription details include name, amount, date, and renewal period (e.g., daily, weekly, monthly).
       
4. **Email Reminders**
     - Automated email notifications for upcoming subscription renewals.
     - Powered by Nodemailer with configurable SMTP settings.

5. **Security**
     - Used Arcjet to prevent from bot attacks & repeated backend calls
     - JWT-based authentication for protected routes.
  
## ðŸ“‹Technologies
  - Node.js: JavaScript runtime for the backend.
  - Express.js: Web framework for building the RESTful API.
  - MongoDB: NoSQL database for storing user and subscription data.
  - Mongoose: ODM for MongoDB data modeling.
  - JWT: JSON Web Tokens for secure authentication.
  - Bcrypt: Password hashing for security.
  - Nodemailer: Email sending for subscription reminders.
  - arckjet: prevents bot attacks and spam calls
  - dotenv: load environment variables from a .env file into process.env 

## ðŸš€ Installation
1. **Clone the Repository**
```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/website-highlight-saver.git
   cd website-highlight-saver
   ```
2. **Install Dependencies**
```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. **Set Up MongoDB**
  - Ensure MongoDB is installed and running locally, or use a cloud provider like MongoDB Atlas.
  - Update the MongoDB connection string in the .env file (see Configuration)
    
4. **Run the Application**
```bash
  npm start
   ```
The server will start on http://localhost:5500 (or the port specified in .env).

## Configuration
Create a .env file (for development) in the project root with the following environment variables:
```bash
#PORT
PORT=5500
SERVER_URL

#ENVIRONMENT
NODE_ENV

#DATABASE
DB_URI

#JWT AUTH

JWT_SECRET
JWT_EXPIRES_IN

#ARCJET
ARCJET_KEY
ARCJET_ENV

#UPSTASH
QSTASH_URL
QSTASH_TOKEN

#NODEMAILER
EMAIL_PASSWORD
  ```

& create a production env file with following variables:
```bash
NODE_ENV = 'production'

#UPSTASH
QSTASH_URL
QSTASH_TOKEN
QSTASH_CURRENT_SIGNING_KEY
QSTASH_NEXT_SIGNING_KEY

#VERCEL DEPLOY LINK
VERCEL
   ```
Note: if you are hosting using vercel, better to write all required production level (non imp. ones) in the env section of vercel.

   - Create an env.js file and extract env variables using dotenv package. And export it from that files for other files to be used.

## Usage
   - Start the Server: Run npm start to launch the server.
   - Test API Endpoints: Use tools like Postman to use or interact with the APIs
   - Receive Email Reminders: The system automatically checks for upcoming subscription renewals and sends email reminders to users based on the configured schedule.
